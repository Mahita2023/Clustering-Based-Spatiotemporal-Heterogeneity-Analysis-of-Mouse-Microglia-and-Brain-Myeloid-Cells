This project focuses on the spatiotemporal heterogeneity analysis of mouse microglia and brain myeloid cells. In the study, firstly, the data of gene expression levels must be preprocessed and thus will undergo processes such as normalization and significant feature selection. This will help with the removal of its noise and irrelevant features, effectively. Then, three widely used clustering algorithms will be used to identify different types of brain myeloid cells (affinity propagation, agglomeration clustering, k means) and explore whether brain myeloid cells are distinctive in different development stages and regions in the brain. Moreover, more than three kinds of data visualization techniques based on dimensionality reduction will be applied to make the clustering results direct to show. Finally, the positional migration of different clusters in the dimensionality reduction coordinate system, reflecting the change of cells at different developmental stages are observed in each of the clustering algorithms with 12 different combinations of age and region data.
